# Smart-Trolley-STM32-and-RFID-EM18

## Introduction 
The main aim of our project is to reduce the time spent during the wait in the queue at the billing counter. By using the RFID technology, we are able to scan multiple items at a given time. RFID Reader/Writer is mounted upon the cart which scans Real Time objects placed inside the cart and displays the total amount upon the LCD mounted on the trolley thus reducing the total time taken by any person during checkout.
